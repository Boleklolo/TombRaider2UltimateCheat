# üó°Ô∏è Tomb Raider II: Extreme Trainer  
### *"Unshackle Lara. Break the rules."*  
Made with care and caffeine by **Boleklolo**

---

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCLAIMER**:  
> This trainer is **unfinished**, experimental, and a bit of a chaotic masterpiece. Some features might not work on all levels. Some might explode (figuratively). Updates will depend on popularity and user feedback.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **STEAM-ONLY NOTICE**:  
> This trainer was made and tested **exclusively** for the **Steam version** of *Tomb Raider II*, specifically using the `Tomb2Cheat.exe` build from that release. It has **not been tested** on other versions (GOG, original CD, etc.) and **may not work properly** with them.

> üî• **NOTE**: Cheats like **health**, **air**, or **animations** must be re-enabled after loading a new level, as the game resets memory on load.  
> üß† Tip: Press `F1` in-game to reapply relevant cheats automatically.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Launch Sequence

1. **Use `Tomb2Cheat.exe`**  
   Not the default `Tomb2.exe`. If you don't it may still work but it contains some invulnerability code like no spike or lava deaths.

2. **Run `TombRaider2_Trainer.exe`**  
   Start the trainer *after* launching the game.  
   You should see:
"Attached to process
Process ID: [number]
Module Base: 0x00400000"

3. **Enable Your Chaos**  
Toggle cheats with checkboxes. Most apply immediately. Some require reloading a level (e.g., door collisions).

| ‚úÖ Climb Anywhere | Lara treats every wall as a ladder. Rock climber hands. |
| ‚úÖ Walkable Slopes | Makes steep angles walkable. Better when combined with Noclip. |
| ‚úÖ Fly | Hold still before activating. May mess up Lara‚Äôs rotation temporarily. Turn off and on again to fix. |
| ‚úÖ Fast Running | Gotta go fast. |

## üßØ Troubleshooting

### ‚ùì Can't attach the trainer?

- Use the **Steam version** and launch `Tomb2Cheat.exe`
- Run both the trainer and game as **Administrator**
- Disable antivirus that may block memory manipulation

### ‚ùó Door collision not working?

- You **must reload the level** after enabling the cheat for door memory edits to apply.

### üêõ Something‚Äôs weird?

- It‚Äôs meant to be weird. It‚Äôs called *Extreme Trainer* for a reason.
- Bugs are features, mostly.


## üß† Trainer Lore

Back in the day, there was a legendary Tomb Raider II cheat video by **Mr. Bombo**, aka **Mr. Cheater**. It amazed people, it amaze **me**.

Watching Lara walk through doors, swim through the air, or simply never die...  
I had no idea how it was done ‚Äî but I knew I wanted to do it too.

So I learned **C++**, studied **x86 assembly**, and eventually figured out how to bend executables to my will. This trainer is my tribute to that era.
