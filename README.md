# 🗡️ Tomb Raider II: Extreme Trainer  
### *"Unshackle Lara. Break the rules. Witness chaos."*  
Made with care and caffeine by **Boleklolo**

---

> ⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**:  
> This trainer is **unfinished**, experimental, and a bit of a chaotic masterpiece. Some features might not work on all levels. Some might explode (figuratively). Updates will depend on popularity and user feedback.

> 🔥 **NOTE**: Cheats like **health**, **air**, or **animations** must be re-enabled if you load a different level's save. The game just loves resetting memory.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Launch Sequence

1. **Start with `Tomb2Cheat.exe`**  
   Not `Tomb2.exe`. This custom build lets the trainer hook memory, change physics, and bend reality.

2. **Open `TombRaider2_Trainer.exe`**  
   Run the trainer after the game. A successful attach will show:
''Attached to process
Process ID: [number]
Module Base: 0x00400000''


3. **Enable Cheats**  
Use the GUI's checkboxes to toggle real-time cheats. No restarting needed (except doors sometimes 👀).

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

### ❓ Can't attach the trainer?

- Use `Tomb2Cheat.exe`, not the original EXE.
- Run both game and trainer **as Administrator**.
- Ensure antivirus isn’t blocking memory access.

### ❗ Door collision not working?

- You **must reload the level** for door memory changes to apply.

### 🐛 Something’s weird?

- Yeah, it’s an extreme trainer. That’s the fun.
- Bugs = Flavor in this soup.

## 🌌 Trainer Lore

> Why does this exist? What inspired you? A section for personal notes, storytelling, or random facts.

📦 _Example:_

> I made this trainer after getting sick of drowning during the Maria Doria levels. I wanted Lara to feel like a goddess — untouchable, unstoppable, and capable of breaking physics at will.
