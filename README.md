# Tomb Raider II Extreme Trainer by Boleklolo

This trainer provides a variety of enhancements and modifications for your Tomb Raider II gameplay experience.

**Disclaimer:** This trainer is unfinished and might get updates if it gets enough popularity.

## How to Use

1.  **Launch `Tomb2Cheat.exe`:** It is crucial that you launch the game using `Tomb2Cheat.exe` and **NOT** `Tomb2.exe`. This is necessary for certain cheats, particularly "instakill prevention" features, to function correctly.
2.  **Run the Trainer:** Once `Tomb2Cheat.exe` is running, launch this trainer application.
3.  **Attach to Process:** The trainer should automatically detect and attach to the `Tomb2Cheat.exe` process (as shown by "Attached to process" and a "Process ID"). If not, you might need to try launching the game first and then the trainer, or vice-versa.
4.  **Enable Cheats:** Simply click on the checkboxes next to the desired cheats to enable or disable them.

## Features

### Movement Enhancements

* **Noclip (No collision) (Doom style):** Allows you to pass through walls and objects. (Works well with slope fix)
* **Ignore Water (Turn Lara to a scuba diver on foot):** Allows Lara to move as if she's underwater even on land.
* **Walkable Slopes (Note: Works better with noclip):** Modifies slope physics to allow easier traversal.
