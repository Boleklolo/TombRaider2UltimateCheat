# 🗡️ Tomb Raider II Extreme Trainer by Boleklolo

Supercharge your **Tomb Raider II** experience with this feature-rich external trainer. Whether you want to explore without boundaries, gain a tactical edge, or just break the game for fun, this tool gives you total control over Lara's world.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get everything working correctly:

### 1. Launch the Correct Game Executable
Always launch the game using `Tomb2Cheat.exe` — **NOT** `Tomb2.exe`. This custom executable enables core memory hooks used by the trainer, including advanced cheats like "instakill prevention."

### 2. Run the Trainer
After the game is running, launch the trainer application (`TombRaider2_Trainer.exe` or similar).

### 3. Attach to Process
The trainer should automatically detect and attach to the `Tomb2Cheat.exe` process. You’ll see confirmation messages like `Attached to process` and a displayed `Process ID`.

If it doesn't attach automatically:
- Try launching the trainer before or after launching the game.
- Ensure `Tomb2Cheat.exe` is running.

### 4. Enable Cheats
Use the intuitive checkbox interface to toggle cheats on and off in real time.
